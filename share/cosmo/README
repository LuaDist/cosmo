Cosmo is a "safe templates" engine.  It allows you to fill nested
templates, providing many of the advantages of Turing-complete
template engines, without without the downside of allowing arbitrary
code in the templates.

The current version of Cosmo is 10.04.06. This release fixes a bug
in the previous release, 10.03.31, that raised errors when a selector
had embedded quotes.

The previous version, 10.03.31, added, expressions to selectors $(<exp>),
allowed nested [[ ]] in templates, made commas between subtemplates
optional, and added a second parameter to cosmo.yield that tells Cosmo
the first parameter is a literal to be included in the expansion instead
of an environment.
 
Cosmo is installed as a rock. To install the most recent release
do `luarocks install cosmo`. The Cosmo rock is in the standard
repository. Installation on UNIX-based systems need the gcc toolchain.
