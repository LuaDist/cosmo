Cosmo is a "safe templates" engine.  It allows you to fill nested
templates, providing many of the advantages of Turing-complete
template engines, without without the downside of allowing arbitrary
code in the templates.

The current version of Cosmo is 9.09.22. This version adds expressions to
selector arguments, and adds more error detection when compiling templates.
 
Cosmo is installed as a rock. To install the most recent release
do `luarocks install cosmo`. The Cosmo rock is in the standard
repository. Installation on UNIX-based systems need the gcc toolchain.
